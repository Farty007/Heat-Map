# Heat-Map
Class Project - Create a heat map of a plate, where the bottom edge is maintained at 200 C, the right edge is maintained at 100 C and the other 2 edges are maintained at 0 C. Create a heat map, of how the temperature changes on the 2D plate, and understand the effect of creating larger meshes. 

The code is written for jyupter notebook but can be easily transferred to any normal python file

It also includes different methods used to solve a matrix and compares them to each other, along with comparing the mesh sizes
